# Contributing to Escape Room Builder Frontend

We're thrilled that you're interested in contributing to the Escape Room Builder! This document provides guidelines and instructions to help you contribute effectively.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork and Clone the Repository**: Start by forking the repository and then cloning it locally.

2. **Set Up Your Environment**:
   - Ensure you have Ruby and Jekyll installed. If not, follow the instructions [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).
   - Install dependencies by running `bundle install` in the project directory.

## Understanding the Architecture

- Familiarize yourself with the Jekyll site structure and how it integrates with the backend.
- Review the [Escape Room Builder Backend](https://github.com/zackrylangford/escape-room-builder-backend) to understand the full scope of the project.

## Working with AWS Cognito

- Since our API is secured with AWS Cognito, you'll need access for backend testing.
- If you require access for development and testing, please [open an issue](https://github.com/zackrylangford/escape-room-builder-frontend/issues) to discuss it further.
- You can also set up your own Cognito pool and configure the backend to use it if you are familiar with AWS.If you are building your backend, make sure that your data structure matches the structure of the pre-built backend so that the frontend can interact with it (or do what you want :) ).
